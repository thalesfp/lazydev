Scripts I use daily in my work environment. Why? Because I love scripts! :)

### p.sh

Uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to find and run npm scripts

```alias p="zsh ~/path/to/p.sh"```

### commit.sh

In my team, we need to prepend the Jira task ID in each commit, so I create this script to help me do not forget to do this.

```alias co="zsh ~/path/to/commit.sh"```

### wakeup/sleep

Scripts used with [sleepwatcher](https://www.bernhard-baehr.de/) and [blueutil](https://github.com/toy/blueutil) to disconnect my Bluetooth phone when the notebook sleeps. Helps me saves a lot of battery.
