# lazydev

Scripts I use daily in my work environment.

### p.sh

Uses fzf to find and run npm scripts

### commit.sh

In my team, we need to prepend the Jira task ID in each commit, so I create this script to help me do not forget to do this.

### wakeup/sleep

Scripts used with [sleepwatcher](https://www.bernhard-baehr.de/) to disconnect my Bluetooth phone when the notebook sleeps. Helps me saves a lot of battery.
