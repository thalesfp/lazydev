Scripts I use daily in my work environment. Why? Because I love scripts! :)

### p.sh

Uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to find and run npm scripts

```bash
alias p="zsh ~/path/to/p.sh"
```

### commit.sh

In my team, we need to prepend the Jira task ID in each commit message, so I created this script to help me with this.

```bash
alias co="zsh ~/path/to/commit.sh"
```

### wakeup/sleep

Scripts used with [sleepwatcher](https://www.bernhard-baehr.de/) and [blueutil](https://github.com/toy/blueutil) to disconnect my Bluetooth phone when the notebook sleeps. Helps me saves a lot of battery.
